The medical team has confirmed that he has made a complete recovery and is now working on regaining match fitness.</p><p>Johnson's return comes as a particular boost, as the central midfielder has missed the last five matches with a more serious ankle ligament injury. His recovery has progressed ahead of schedule, with the player responding well to an intensive rehabilitation program.</p><p>\"Having both players back is a massive boost for us,\" said the team's head coach. \"They're both key figures in our squad, not just for their technical abilities but also for their leadership qualities. We've missed their presence on the pitch.\"</p><p>The coaching staff will make a final decision on their involvement in the upcoming fixture after assessing their performance in training over the next few days. While both players are unlikely to start, they could feature from the bench if deemed match-ready.</p><p>In other injury news, defensive midfielder David Williams remains sidelined with a knee problem and is expected to be out for at least another two weeks. Young prospect James Taylor has returned to light training following his recovery from illness but is not yet ready for first-team action.</p>",
